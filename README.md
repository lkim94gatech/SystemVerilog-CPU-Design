# SystemVerilog CPU Design

This repository contains the implementation of a basic CPU design in **SystemVerilog**. The project includes various modules for performing fetch, decode, execute, memory operations, and write-back stages in a simplified CPU architecture.

## Files Included

- **ALU.sv**: Implements the Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for performing arithmetic and logical operations.
- **Core.sv**: Main CPU module that integrates all other components and coordinates the instruction flow.
- **Decode.sv**: Handles instruction decoding and control signal generation.
- **DFlipFlop.sv**: A D Flip-Flop module used for state retention.
- **DRAM.sv**: Implements the main memory module for data storage.
- **Fetch.sv**: Fetches instructions from memory.
- **LSU.sv**: Load-Store Unit for handling memory access instructions.
- **Register_File.sv**: Implements the CPU's register file for operand storage.
- **core_pkg.sv**: Contains the package definitions and constants used across the design.

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic 5-stage pipelined CPU design. The pipeline stages include:

1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**: Fetches the next instruction from memory using the `Fetch` module.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**: Decodes the instruction into control signals using the `Decode` module.
3. **Execute (EX)**: Performs arithmetic and logical operations using the `ALU` module.
4. **Memory Access (MEM)**: Handles memory read and write operations via the `LSU` and `DRAM` modules.
5. **Write Back (WB)**: Writes results back to the `Register_File`.

## Features

- **Pipelined Architecture**: Implements a 5-stage pipeline for executing instructions.
- **ALU Operations**: Supports basic arithmetic (ADD, SUB) and logical operations (AND, OR).
- **Memory Operations**: Load and store data to/from memory using `DRAM`.
- **Register File**: Contains a set of general-purpose registers for instruction execution.
- **Control Signals**: Generated by the `Decode` module for instruction control flow.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **SystemVerilog Simulator**: Recommended tools include:
  - ModelSim
  - VCS
  - QuestaSim
- **Waveform Viewer**: For debugging and simulation results.

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd SystemVerilog-CPU
   ```
2. **Compile the Modules: Use your preferred SystemVerilog simulator to compile all .sv files**:
   ```bash
   vlog *.sv # For ModelSim
   ```
3. ** Run Simulation: Execute the testvench and view the results:
   ```bash
   vsim -do "run -all"
   ```
4. **View Waveforms: Open the generated .wlf file in a waveform viewer for debugging**:
   ```bash
   vsim wave.wlf
   ```
